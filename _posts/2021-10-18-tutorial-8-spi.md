# Colors!

In this tutorial we're going to figure out how to light up the pads and buttons, as well as read their current values, via the SPI.
Our research into the pad colors yields a meaningful improvement over the factory operating system: we can use timing 
and animation to cycle the red, green, and blue LED cycles and achieve 1000s of distinct colors, where the factory default
only permits 17.
